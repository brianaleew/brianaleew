As a former Social Worker, I have always loved solving challenges, helping people and learning new things. Most importantly, I have seen and understood the power of constant change. For these reasons the tech industry has always naturally caught my eye, but now it has my full attention. <br>

After just 3 months at General Assembly learning frontend and backend code, I know there's no better place for me to solve problems than right on my computer screen. With every day that passes I get better and better at making applications that solve problems for everyone! So, take a look at my repositories and give me a follow! The code only gets better from here and I would love to create new code with great minds! 

Fun Facts About Me:
- I love to travel! (Jamaica is my favorite destination!) 
- I'm a woman of many hobbies (:video_game:, :book:, :art:)
- I listened to over 78,000 min of music in 2022 (Spotify Wrapped)(I really love music!)
